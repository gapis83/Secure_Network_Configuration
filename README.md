This project involves a series of tasks aimed at configuring network settings and ensuring secure communication between multiple virtual machines (VMs).

Tasks Summary
1. Static Routing Configuration
Set up static routing between two computers to ensure they can communicate directly. This involves configuring the routing tables on each machine.

2. Network Address Translation (NAT)
Implement NAT to allow internal network devices to access external networks using a single IP address. This is essential for conserving IP addresses and enhancing security.

3. Network Firewall Setup
Configure a firewall to control incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined security rules. This task includes setting up rules to allow or block specific traffic types.

4. SSH Tunnels
Use SSH tunneling to securely forward network traffic from one machine to another. This involves:

Setting up a local TCP forwarding from one VM to another to access a web server.
Configuring remote TCP forwarding to allow access to a web server on a different VM.
